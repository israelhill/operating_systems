EECS 338: Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming

To run:
	$ make
	$ make run

Once the program is running, the parent process will generate 25 Carbon threads
followed by 100 Hydrogen processes. Each of the threads will wait at a barrier until
there is enough of them to create a Methane molecule. One thread will print,
"Crossed barrier, created Methane!" and terminate. The other 4 threads will
terminate without printing. 

As each atoms reaches the barrier, the count of each atom waiting will be printed
such as: C: 0 | H: 2. When the final atom required to create a Methane arrives, 
the count will not be printed. Instead, the thread will cross the barrier and print
"Crossed barrier, created Methane!".

The parent will wait for all the threads to terminate, then it will exit.

Clean Up:
	$ make clean
